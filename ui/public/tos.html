    <h1>Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to this web application (the "App"), a hobby project created and maintained by a single developer ("I," "me," or "the Developer"). This App helps manage character sheets for the tabletop role-playing game Wildsea. I am not affiliated with the authors or publishers of Wildsea, and this App is an independent, non-commercial project.</p>

    <h2>2. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Data Collection</h3>
    <p>The App collects data that you provide when using it, such as account information (if you use social login) and any character data you choose to input. This data is used solely to provide the functionality of the App.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Data Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Debugging and Development</strong>: I may access data to debug, develop, or improve the App. However, I do not routinely monitor or review user data.</li>
        <li><strong>No Data Sales</strong>: Your data will not be sold, rented, or otherwise distributed to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Data Security</h3>
    <p>I make reasonable efforts to secure your data and protect it from unauthorized access. However, as a solo developer, my resources are limited, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>Your data will not be shared with third parties, except where required by law or in situations necessary to protect the Appâ€™s integrity (e.g., to prevent abuse).</p>

    <h3>2.5 Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on the App, and continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of any revised terms.</p>

    <h2>3. Terms of Service</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Use of the App</h3>
    <p>By using the App, you agree to the following terms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Guarantees</strong>: This App is provided as-is, without any guarantees or warranties. I am not responsible for any issues, bugs, or interruptions you may encounter while using it.</li>
        <li><strong>No Liability</strong>: You use this App at your own risk. I am not liable for any losses or damages that may arise from your use of the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Shutdown and Changes</strong>: I reserve the right to shut down the App or make changes to its features at any time, for any reason, without prior notice.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Hosting Option</strong>: The full source code for this App is available at <a href="https://github.com/jarrod-lowe/wildsea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jarrod-lowe/wildsea</a>. You are welcome to run your own version under your control. However, I do not provide support for self-hosted instances.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p>All rights to the Wildsea game, its rules, and related content are owned by their respective creators. This App is an independent tool and is not endorsed or authorized by the creators of Wildsea. The character data you create belongs to you.</p>

    <h3>3.3 No Promises for Support</h3>
    <p>While I may address issues or implement new features, I make no promises to do so. This is a hobby project, and updates are made at my discretion.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Termination</h3>
    <p>I may terminate or suspend access to the App for any user, at any time, for any reason.</p>

    <h3>3.5 Changes to These Terms</h3>
    <p>I may update these Terms of Service at any time. Changes will be posted on the App, and continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of any revised terms.</p>
